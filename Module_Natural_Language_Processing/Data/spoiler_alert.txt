O, I die, Horatio!
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
I cannot live to hear the news from England,
     But I do prophesy th' election lights
On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
             
Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
