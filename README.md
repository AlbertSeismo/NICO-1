# Amaral Lab Intro to Data Science
 
These materials constitute the textbook for NICO 101/401 - Introduction to Programming for Big Data.
This course will teach you the basics of programming in Python, visualizing data, and web-scraping 
as well as analyzing unstructured text, structured data, and images. 

This course does not explicitly use any 'big' datasets during the quarter, what it does do is teach
you the fundamentals of programming and analysis that can then be scaled to any size data. As a part
of this we will discuss the basics of statistical analysis and how that can be applied to datasets.

Any comments, questions, or concerns can be directed to:

* Adam R. Pah <adamrpah@gmail.com>
* Helio Tejedor <heltena@northwestern.edu>

## Software Installation

This bootcamp uses the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Currently, it installs Python 3.9.12.

There are videos to help you understand the installation process; however, it is a simple installer
package that should be similar to any other program (so don't be afraid!).

**You must have Python installed before you can start work through the notebooks.** 

**If you are taking NICO 101/401, you need to have Python installed by the first day of class!**

We also require that you have a relatively modern operating system. 

For Windows, you must be using Windows 7 or later.

For Mac, you must be using OS X 10.9 or later.

## Downloading Course Materials

The course materials can be downloaded from the repository's [github page](http://github.com/amarallab/Amaral_Lab_Intro_to_Data_Science). 
Just download the zip file, unzip it onto your Desktop, and rename the directory `NICO-101`.

## Using the Course Materials

This course will be conducted using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org). Jupyter Notebook 
is a 'web-based interactive computational environment', meaning that it allows to write and execute python code in a 
web page from your own computers. Jupyter Notebook is an excellent environment in which learn  
the basics of Python programming and computational data analysis.

Jupyter Notebook is installed by default with the Anaconda Python distribution and can be launched from the Anaconda 
Navigator program. We have an [introductory video](https://youtu.be/Pul4cqoPLbE) that details how to
launch and use Jupyter notebook.
